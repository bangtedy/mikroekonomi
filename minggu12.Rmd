# LEARNING OUTCOMES

After studying this chapter, you will be able to

- Outline the monopolistic and competitive elements of monopolistic competition
- Describe the sources of oligopoly and explain why some industries become oligopolies
- Explain why predicting oligopoly behavior is so difficult
- Summarize the similarities and differences between an oligopoly and perfect competition in terms of price, output, and long-run profitability
 
---
# INTRODUCTION

- Perfect competition and monopoly are extreme market structures. 
- Under perfect competition, many suppliers offer an identical product and, in the long run, entry and exit erase economic profit. 
- A monopolist supplies a product with no close substitutes in a market where 
natural or artificial barriers keep out would-be competitors, so a monopolist can earn economic profit in the long run. 
- These polar market structures are logically appealing and offer a useful 
description of some industries observed in the economy.
- But most firms fit into neither market structure. 
- This chapter examines the two remaining market structures that together 
account for most firms in the economy.

> A market structure with many firms selling products that are substitutes but different enough that each firmâ€™s demand curve slopes downward; firm entry is 
relatively easy
