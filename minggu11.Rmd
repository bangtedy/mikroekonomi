# LEARNING OUTCOMES

After studying this chapter, you will be able to

- List three barriers to entry and explain how each can help create market power
- Distinguish marginal revenue and average revenue for a monopolist, and explain why 
marginal revenue is less than average revenue
- Determine the profit-maximizing or loss-minimizing production level for a monopolist
- Summarize what causes the deadweight loss of monopoly
- Outline the factors that could cause the deadweight loss of monopoly to be lower or higher than expected
- Explain why a firm with market power might decide to charge different groups different prices

# AN INTRODUCTION TO MONOPOLY

- A monopoly is the sole supplier of a product with no close substitutes. 
- There is only one supplier in the market but there are many demanders, so 
many that no buyer has any control over the price. 

---
# Why do some markets come to be dominated by a single supplier? 

> A monopolized market is characterized by barriers to entry, which are restrictions on the entry of new firms into an industry.

---

# BARRIERS TO ENTRY

- Legal Restrictions
  - Patents and Invention Incentives
  - Licenses and Other Entry Restrictions
- Economies of Scale
- Control of Essential Resources
